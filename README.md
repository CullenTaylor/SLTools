==========================

Bash scripts to automate common tasks when deploying or working with an
OpenStack/BlueBox cloud environment. Previously, this repo was broken up into three repos (rmstop_controller_services, copy_ssh_keys, and bootstrap_deployer). I noticed that I was having to clone different combinations, or even all, of these in many different places. Thus, I decided to merge them into one repo. Further additions will be made as needs arise.
